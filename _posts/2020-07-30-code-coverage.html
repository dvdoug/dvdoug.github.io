<p class="lead">
    In 2003, with the release of <a href="https://xdebug.org/">Xdebug</a> 1.2, Derick Rethans introduced the ability to
    collect code coverage data to the PHP ecosystem for the first time. In 2004, with the release of
    <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> 2, Sebastian Bergmann made the first real use of this new power by allowing
    developers to evaluate the effectiveness of their test suites by generating coverage reports.
</p>

<p>
    Since then, <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage">php-code-coverage</a> has been spun
    out from PHPUnit into a reusable standalone component, and PHPDBG and
    <a href="https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov">PCOV</a> have been created as alternative coverage drivers. Fundamentally
    however, nothing has changed for developers about the basic process in the past 16 years.
</p>

<p>
    In August 2020 with the release of php-code-coverage 9.0 and the linked releases of PHPUnit 9.3 and
    <a href="https://github.com/dvdoug/behat-code-coverage">behat-code-coverage</a> 5.0 a new way of looking at coverage
    will become available.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="recap">A quick recap of the basics</h2>

<p>
    Most PHP developers will be familiar with the concept of writing automated tests for your code.
    Closely linked to that concept, is that of <dfn>code coverage</dfn>, which is the idea of measuring the percentage
    of your code that is executed or "covered" by the test suite. For example, if we had the following code:
</p>

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
class PercentCalculator
{
    public function __construct(int $numerator, int $denominator)
    {
        $this->numerator = $numerator;
        $this->denominator = $denominator;
    }

    public function calculatePercent(): float
    {
        return round($this->numerator / $this->denominator * 100, 1);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>We could write a PHPUnit test as follows:</p>

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
class PercentCalculatorTest extends PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testTwentyIntoForty(): void
    {
        $calculator = new PercentCalculator(20, 40);
        self::assertEquals(50.0, $calculator->calculatePercent());
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Running that through PHPUnit confirms that in this trivial example, we have achieved 100% coverage.</p>
<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator1.php.html"></iframe>



<h2 class="section-heading" id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>
    In that example code however, there was actually a small potential bug. If <code>$denominator</code> is <var>0</var>
    then we'll get a divide by zero error. Let's patch that and see what happens.
</p>

{% highlight php linenos %}
<?php
class PercentCalculator
{
    public function __construct(int $numerator, int $denominator)
    {
        $this->numerator = $numerator;
        $this->denominator = $denominator;
    }

    public function calculatePercent(): float
    {
        //I could have sanity checked the value instead, but this specific fix is important for the point I want to make
        return $this->denominator ? round($this->numerator / $this->denominator * 100, 1) : 0.0;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator2.php.html"></iframe>

<p>
    Even though line 12 now has a ternary <code>if/else</code> in it, and even though we haven't written a test to
    check if our handling of <var>0</var> is correct the report is telling us we still have 100% code coverage.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Because <em>part</em> of the line is covered by a test, <em>all</em> of the line is marked as covered.</strong>
    This can be very misleading!
</p>

<p>
    Other code constructs can often exhibit the same problems when simply counting whether a line was executed or not,
    for example:
</p>

{% highlight php linenos %}
if ($a || $b || $c) {    // testing just *one* of these
    doSomething();       // possibilities will count as 100% coverage
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php linenos %}
public function pluralise(string $thing, int $count): string
{
    $string = $count . ' ' . $thing;

    if ($count > 1) {     // if you only test $count >= 2, you'll still get 100% coverage
        $string .= 's';   // because there are no dedicated source code lines for $count === 1
    }                     // that can be marked as uncovered

    return $string;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 class="section-heading" id="alternative">Alternative metrics</h2>
<p>
    Xdebug since version 2.3 has actually had the ability to collect not just the line-based metrics that we all
    know, but also the alternative metrics of branch and path coverage. Introducing the feature, Derick's blog post
    ended with this infamous statement:
</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p class="mb-0">
        Now it's just waiting until Sebastian (or somebody else) has time to upgrade PHP_CodeCoverage to show the branch and path coverage. Happy hacking!
    </p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>Derick Rethans, January 2015</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
    After waiting 5 years for this mysterious ‚Äúsomebody else‚ÄùüëÄ to show up, I decided to give implementing it a
    go myself.
</p>

<p>
    Many thanks to Sebastian Bergmann for accepting my pull requests.
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading" id="branch-coverage">Branch coverage</h2>
<p>
    In all but the simplest code, there are places where the execution path can diverge in 2 (or more ways). These occur
    at every decision point, for example at every <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> or <code>while</code>.
    Each ‚Äúside‚Äù of those divergence points is its own <dfn>branch</dfn>. Where there is no decision point, then the
    execution flow has just a single branch.
</p>

<p>
    N.B. Although the same tree-based metaphor is used, a branch in this context is <em>not</em> the same thing as a
    branch in a version control system, don't get them confused!
</p>

<p>
    When branch and path coverage is enabled, the generated HTML report from php-code-coverage now includes additional
    views to show the branch coverage and the path coverage alongside the traditional line coverage report.
    Here's what the branch view looks like using the same example code as before:
</p>

<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator3.php.html"></iframe>

<p>
    As you can see, the summary box at the top of the page indicates immediately that although we have 100% coverage
    on the line-based metric, that we don't on either the branch or path basis (paths are detailed in the next section).
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, line 12 is highlighted in warning yellow to indicate that coverage for that particular line is
    incomplete (a line with 0% coverage would show in red, consistent with the traditional view).
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the more eagle-eyed may have noticed that additional lines are colour-coded compared to the line-based
    coverage view. This is because branches are based on the execution flow inside the PHP interpreter, and the first
    branch of each function is considered to start at function entry. This is different from line-based coverage where
    only the function body is considered to contain executable lines, the function declaration itself is considered
    non-executable.
</p>

<h3>Identifying branches</h3>
<p>
    Such differences between what the PHP interpreter considers to be a logically distinct branch of code, and the
    mental model of a developer can make understanding the numbers tricky. For example if you asked me how many branches
    <code>calculatePercent()</code> had, I would say the answer is 2 (the special case for <var>0</var> and
    the general case). However, looking at the report from php-code-coverage above, this 1 line function actually has‚Ä¶4?!
</p>

<p>
    To help developer understanding of what a branch is, and also to help identify more clearly branches that are hidden
    from source code, the branch report also has a secondary view. This can be found
    underneath the main one, and shows an exploded view of each individual branch. It looks like this:
</p>

<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator4.php.html"></iframe>

<p>
    It's still not <em>completely</em> obvious, but from that it is now possible to understand what the branches in
    <code>calculatePercent()</code> actually are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Branch 1 starts at function entry and includes the evaluation of <code>$this->denominator</code></li>
    <li>Execution then diverges into branches 2 and 3 depending on whether the special case is hit or not</li>
    <li>Branch 4 is where branches 2/3 recombine and consists of the <code>return</code> and function exit</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Mentally mapping branches back to individual pieces of source code is a new skill that takes a little bit of
    practice, but it's definitely easier to perform on code that is easy to read and understand in the first place.
    If your code is full of ‚Äúclever‚Äù 1-liners where multiple pieces of logic combine like this one, then expect more
    difficulty compared to code that prefers to structure things over multiple lines where the line/branch relationship
    is more likely to be 1-1. Written in a different style, the same logic would look this instead:
</p>

<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator5.php.html"></iframe>

<h3>Clover</h3>
<p>
    If you're using php-code-coverage's Clover report to export coverage data to another system, this now also benefits
    from having branch coverage enabled by now being able to export data under the
    <code>conditionals</code> and <code>coveredconditionals</code> keys. Previously (or with branch coverage disabled),
    these values are hard-coded to 0 in the export.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="path-coverage">Path coverage</h2>
<p>
    <dfn>Paths</dfn> are the possible combinations of branches. In the case of the <code>calculatePercent()</code>
    example, there are 2 possible paths as outlined above:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Branch 1, followed by branch 2 and then branch 4</li>
    <li>Branch 1, followed by branch 3 and then branch 4</li>
</ul>

<iframe src="assets/coverage-blog/PercentCalculator6.php.html"></iframe>

<p>
    Often however, the number of paths is more than than the number of branches for example in code that has many
    conditionals and loops. The following example taken from php-code-coverage has 23 branches, but
    there are actually <em>65</em> different combinations of execution path that can be taken through the function:
</p>

{% highlight php linenos %}
final class File extends AbstractNode
{
    public function numberOfTestedMethods(): int
    {
        if ($this->numTestedMethods === null) {
            $this->numTestedMethods = 0;

            foreach ($this->classes as $class) {
                foreach ($class['methods'] as $method) {
                    if ($method['executableLines'] > 0 &&
                        $method['coverage'] === 100) {
                        $this->numTestedMethods++;
                    }
                }
            }

            foreach ($this->traits as $trait) {
                foreach ($trait['methods'] as $method) {
                    if ($method['executableLines'] > 0 &&
                        $method['coverage'] === 100) {
                        $this->numTestedMethods++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return $this->numTestedMethods;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<span class="caption text-muted">
    If you're struggling to find all 23 branches, don't forget that each <code>foreach</code> might receive an empty
    iterator, and each <code>if</code> has an invisible <code>else</code>
</span>

<p>
    Yes, that would mean 65 testcases to get 100% path coverage.
</p>

<p>
    The HTML report from php-code-coverage also includes a secondary per-path view in the same style as for branches
    that shows which ones are covered by a test and which aren't.
</p>


<h3>CRAP</h3>

<p>
    Enabling path coverage also has 1 other effect on the displayed metrics and that is on the reported
    <dfn title="Change Risk Anti Pattern">CRAP</dfn> score. The definition promulgated by
    <a href="http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html">crap4j.org</a> uses percentage path coverage as an input into the
    calculation which historically has not been an option for PHP which has used percentage line coverage as
    a substitute. The effect of the change is that for small functions with good coverage, your reported CRAP score is
    likely to stay the same or even decrease. Functions with many paths and poor coverage will start to see much larger
    numbers.
</p>


<h2 class="section-heading" id="enabling">Enabling the new metrics</h2>
<p>
    Branch and path coverage are enabled or disabled together as they are just different views into the
    same underlying execution data.
</p>
<h3>PHPUnit</h3>
<p>
    For PHPUnit 9.3+, the additional metrics are disabled by default and can be enabled either via the CLI or via the
    <kbd>phpunit.xml</kbd> configuration file <em>but only when running under Xdebug</em>. Attempting to enable the
    feature when using either PCOV or PHPDBG will result in a warning about incompatible configuration and no coverage
    will be collected.
</p>

<p>
    From the CLI, use the <code>--path-coverage</code> option: <kbd>vendor/bin/phpunit --path-coverage</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
    For <kbd>phpunit.xml</kbd>, set the <code>pathCoverage</code> attribute to <code>true</code> on the
    <code>coverage</code> element.
</p>

    PHPUnit 9.3 also introduces
    <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/ChangeLog-9.3.md#configuration-of-code-coverage-and-logging-in-phpunitxml">major changes</a>
    to the format of its configuration file so the structure in the above example probably looks different to what you're used to seeing
</span>

<h3>behat-code-coverage</h3>
<p>
    For behat-code-coverage 5.0+, configuration is via <kbd>behat.yml</kbd> using the
    <code>branchAndPathCoverage</code> attribute. It will warn, but still generate coverage if you try and enable it
    when using a driver other than Xdebug to make it easier to use the same configuration file in disparate environments.
    When not configured explicitly, it will be enabled by default when running under Xdebug.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="which">Which metric should I use?</h2>
<p>
    Speaking personally, I will be using the new metrics wherever possible, and having tested them against a few
    different codebases to figure out what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looks like, I think I'm likely to settle on the hybrid approach
    outlined below for my own projects. For professional corporate work, whether to switch metrics is obviously a team
    discussion and I look forward with interest to find out if wider consensus is in alignment with my own thinking or
    if it goes in a different direction.
</p>

<h3>My opinion</h3>

<p>
    100% path coverage is undoubtedly the holy grail, and where <em>reasonably</em> possible I think it's a good metric
    to aim at even if you don't hit it - if you're writing tests, you should be thinking about things like edge cases
    anyway and path coverage helps show whether you got them all.
</p>

<p>
    However, where a method has tens, hundreds or even thousands of paths which is actually not uncommon for
    reasonably complex things, then I won't be spending the time to write the hundreds of tests necessary to achieve that.
    Reasonably, for me, stops at the single digits. Testing is not an intrinsic good, but is a risk
    mitigation tool and an investment in the future. Tests should have a positive return on investment, and spending
    time writing <em>that many</em> tests is rarely likely to pay off. In those situations, I am likely to aim for good
    branch coverage instead as that will at least ensure that I've thought what happens at each decision point.
</p>

<p>
    What I will do in cases of high path numbers (identified by now accurate CRAP scores), is evaluate whether the code in
    in question is doing too many things and whether there exists a sensible way to split it into smaller functions
    that can be reasoned about more carefully. Sometimes there won't, and that's OK - we don't have to fix every single
    project risk. Just knowing about them is also a win. It's also important to remember that function boundaries and
    unit testing of them individually does represent an artificial split of logic and doesn't represent the true complexity of
    your software on an end to end basis. I would therefore encourage <em>not</em> to split large functions up if you're
    doing it purely because of scary path numbers. Do it only where the split reduces cognitive load and aids
    human comprehension.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="disadvantages">Are there reasons not to enable the new metrics?</h2>
<p>
    Yes, performanceüòî. It's not a secret that running code under Xdebug makes it perform <em>incredibly</em> slowly
    compared to PHP's baseline performance, and enabling branch and path coverage makes it worse due to the additional
    overhead of all of the additional execution data it now needs to keep track of internally.
</p>

<p>
    The good news is that the necessity to mitigate performance issues inspired general performance improvements inside
    php-code-coverage that will benefit anyone using Xdebug. Performance of testsuites varies dramatically so it's
    hard to try and extrapolate a rule of thumb, but generating line-based coverage should now be quicker on every
    codebase.
</p>

<p>
    Generating branch and path based coverage is still approximately 3ùë•-5ùë• slower though so do take that into account.
    You may wish to consider enabling it selectively, perhaps only when running individual test files rather than the
    entire test suite, or on a nightly ‚Äúenhanced coverage‚Äù build rather than every push to CI.
</p>

<p>
    Xdebug 3 will be significantly faster than current versions due to work being done on
    modularisation and performance so these caveats should be treated as only applying to Xdebug 2.ùë•. With v3, even with
    the additional overhead to collect the extra data, it should be possible to generate branch and path coverage in
    less time than it takes to get just line coverage today!ü§û
