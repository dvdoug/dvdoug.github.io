<p class="lead">
    Ten years ago, in October 2012, I made the first commit to the <i>PHPCoord</i> open source project on GitHub. This is a
    reconstructed record of the project's origins and subsequent development.

<h2 class="section-heading" id="origins">Origins of the project</h2>

<p>
    I used to work for an educational non-profit that was focused on the area of nurseries and pre-schools. The
    organisation ran about 100 of these directly, and provided advice and support to approx 13,000 others. As part
    of my role in looking after the technical side of the organisation's website, in early 2008 I built a
    “find my nearest childcare” tool (now offline) that could be used by parents of young children. Although
    “find my nearest” tools were relatively common even back then, I did learn that my particular use case had some
    complexities that didn't necessarily apply to the implementations that were described in the blog posts I was
    then reading explaining how to build one:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The number of venues I was working with was ≈13,000. For comparison, the national retailer “B&Q” has about 300.
        This meant an order of magnitude more calculations were necessary on every search than a typical implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        With a retailer, a website team has the possibility of having precise location coordinate data be
        stored centrally as mandated data before a new store can be added to the website. With a primarily membership
        organisation like I was working for, I could hardly demand that each new member signing up be forced to supply
        their building's latitude and longitude. I therefore had to develop a solution for determining this data from
        their postal address.
    </li>
    <li>
        My budget for the project was precisely zero. The entire website ran on a single £59.99/mo dedicated server,
        spending money purchasing location data for a non-core feature was absolutely out of the question.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The second and third of those problems was solved by scraping Multimap (now Bing Maps) for each new postcode that
    the search service hadn't seen before (a daily cron for new venues, realtime for search postcodes). These were then
    stored in a database, and an optimised conversion of the haversine formula into SQL<sup><a href="#fn1" id="f1">1</a></sup>
    <sup><a href="#fn2" id="f2">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn3" id="f3">3</a></sup> was used to determine the relevant results.
</p>

<p>
    In April 2010, Ordnance Survey started to make available <i>Code-Point Open</i>, which is a free dataset that maps
    the centre of every postcode in Great Britain to its easting and northing. Making use of this meant there would be no need
    to abuse Multimap to get the coordinate data anymore, however it did mean that I had to find a method of converting
    eastings and northings into latitudes and longitudes so that the distance calculations would continue to work
    <sup><a href="#fn4" id="f4">4</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="PHPcoord">PHPcoord</h2>

<p>
    After some research, I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100209004025/http://www.jstott.me.uk/phpcoord/"><i>PHPcoord</i></a>
    (lowercase c) by Jonathan Stott. It wasn't ideal in terms of code quality (Jonathan seems to have been an
    academic rather than a professional developer), for instance it had a single large file rather than the conventional
    1 class per file that PHP developers use, and was also written for PHP4 and the PHP4 object model rather than the
    newer, different PHP5 object model.
</p>

<p>
    However those issues weren't showstoppers (PHP4 code did generally run successfully under PHP5) and testing showed
    the code seemed to do the job quite well and so I imported it into <code>lib/</code><sup><a href="#fn6" id="f6">6</a></sup>,
    hooked it up to my Code-Point Open import script and easily generated the latitude and longitude for every postcode in
    Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
    For the next couple of years, everything went well. Periodically I updated <i>Code-Point Open</i> to populate the database
    with any newly created postcodes, and <i>PHPcoord</i> continued to calculate the appropriate latitude and longitudes for
    them.
</p>

<p>
    However, it was becoming increasingly clear that <i>PHPcoord</i> was an abandoned library (the author's website had
    been hacked for years just displaying spam) and therefore the code was never going to be updated for modern PHP.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="initialfork">The initial fork</h2>

<p>
    I therefore decided to fork it, modernise it, and to make the new version publicly available for others to use in
    much the same way that I had been able to benefit myself from the original work.
</p>

<p>
    It's often said that one of the hardest problems in computing is naming things, and the first problem I had was
    what to call the fork. I decided that since this wasn't an original work, it would be morally dishonest to give the
    codebase a completely different name, however I did choose to change the capitalisation (to <i>PHPCoord</i>) since the
    original was always weird to me. For similar reasons, I chose to use <code>php-coord/php-coord</code> as the package
    name for Packagist because I felt that using my own name for the vendor portion would not really be honest.
</p>

<p>
    The choice of Kebab case rather than using the much simpler <code>phpcoord/phpcoord</code> is a decision that
    continues to haunt me to this day though, because I consistently forget the hyphens when I type it out. Lesson
    learnt.
</p>

<p>
    For a version number, I opted against continuing the numbering sequence of <i>PHPcoord</i>, just in case the original
    author ever did come back and release something new. I decided that with the new name, this was a new project and
    thus the first release was <code>v1.0</code>.
</p>

<p>
    This <code>v1.0</code> release of the fork was mostly intended to be cosmetic in nature (compliance with PSR standards),
    and was explicitly designed to be a drop-in replacement for any code using the original project. As it was being
    published with my name attached however, it was also personally important to me to ensure a fairly high level of quality,
    and as such I also added the first unit tests, and made usage of a CI system (Travis CI) to ensure that these would
    be automatically run on every commit and against a variety of PHP versions so that I could make claims about the
    supported versions of PHP with good confidence.
</p>

<p>
    Pleasingly, one the tests I wrote found what appeared to be a rounding issue from the original code which I was able
    to fix. As part of cross-checking what the expected behaviour should actually be though before changing it, I came
    across some worked conversion examples from Ordnance Survey. Those revealed that one of the conversion parameters
    in the code was also slightly wrong (appeared to be a typo), which I was also able to fix. Furthermore, the Ordnance
    Survey documentation explained that the conversion in question was only approximate and thus revealed the <i>PHPcoord</i>
    code was making the classic mistake of confusing the number of decimal places in the output of a calculation with
    its accuracy. That was corrected too, by rounding off to a suitable number of decimal places.
</p>

<p>
    I did add one new feature to that initial release, which was an expanded set of geographical knowledge. The original
    <i>PHPcoord</i> only knew about (and could only convert between), the global WGS84 (GPS) coordinate system and the
    OSGB36 (British) system. Forked <i>PHPCoord</i> also knew about ED50 and NAD27, the appropriate conversion values
    to/from WGS84 for them being taken from a page on Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>
    That initial <code>v1.0</code> was released in February 2013, with an additional minor release
    each year for following three years (not an intentional release pattern, that's just how it worked out).

<p>
    These did additional cleanup, added additional guard checks to the code to avoid potential errors that could be made from
    consuming applications and fixed a different inaccurate value I found in a formula. These also included a fix
    for the first reported bug, which had some mixed feelings for me, namely “I had a bug. It's public :(” but also
    “Yay, people are using my code!”. Luckily for my self-confidence the first few reported bugs all turned out to be
    issues in the original code, rather than from my changes. Of course other bugs, reported later did turn out to be mine.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="version2">Version 2</h2>
<p>
    With version 2, I did a much larger refactoring of the code, taking advantage of the need to not need to
    keep backwards compatibility. This was the first step towards having something resembling a domain model,
    although with hindsight it had some flaws, in particular confusing the concepts of a datum and ellipsoid.
</p>

<p>
    I also received a feature request for, and added support for, the Irish grid systems to complement the existing support
    for the British grid and also added support for 3D coordinates (those including height) because the conversion formula
    was inherently 3D but just assuming 0 for height so adding the (optional) ability to supply an actual height was
    both easy and made sense to do.
</p>

<p>
    <code>v2.0</code> was released in January 2016, with <code>v2.1</code> following in September that year to add a new
    type of distance calculation.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="version3">Version 3</h2>
<p>
    I released <code>v3.0</code> in April 2019, mostly just to bump the minimum version to PHP7 and add the enhanced
    type information that had by that time become expected practice. There were no compelling new features in the release
    although I did take advantage of the BC break to convert to using immutable objects (a feature request).
</p>

<p>
    By this time (and well before if I'm honest), <i>PHPCoord</i> had become a mostly unmaintained project. Although I did
    respond to any issues filed and check compatibility against each new version of PHP, maintenance was definitely
    something that was on the reactive end of the spectrum. The release of version 3 was basically driven by
    embarrassment<sup><a href="#fn7" id="f7">7</a></sup> with both the PHP7 change and the immutability change both
    actually having been committed back in 2017. They just hadn't been released because there weren't any new features
    to justify the cost/benefit of inflicting the BC break on existing users.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="contemplation">Contemplation</h2>
<p>
    After the release of version 3, I began to consider the future of <i>PHPCoord</i>. I was very conscious that despite the
    grandiose name suggesting it was some kind of definitive library, a more accurate name for it would have been
    <i>PHPBritishAndIrishCoordinatesWithAFeebleAttemptAtTheRestOfEuropeAndNorthAmerica</i>. I had obviously known right from the
    start with <code>v1.0</code> that it didn't have any support for e.g. Australia, Africa or Asia, but back then I
    had been under the erroneous impression Europe and the US were catered for. Because I'm British and our coordinate
    system dates from 1936, when I copied the values from Wikipedia for NAD27 and ED50 I thought nothing of it.
</p>

<p>
    It was only later (I'm not entirely sure when) it came to my attention that NAD27 had long since been replaced by
    NAD83, and ED50 had long since been replaced by ETRS89. (Much later) subsequent research told me that for most
    practical purposes those 2 newer systems are actually interchangeable with WGS84 and so they were in-fact kinda
    covered if the end-user was also aware of that fact, but that particular anecdote shows my historically poor level
    of subject knowledge for a library that I was responsible for.
</p>

<p>
    So as I was considering the future of <i>PHPCoord</i>, there were 3 factors in play:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        As unsatisfied as I was with the state of affairs, was I truly ready to “abandon my baby”?
    </li>
    <li>
        Was there an alternative library I could point people at? I hadn't found one back in 2010 when I first started
        using <i>PHPcoord</i>, but that was many, many years ago. Maybe one existed now?
    </li>
    <li>
        If the answers to the first two questions were “no”, what would it take to build something I was actually proud of?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    As it turned out, the answers to the first two questions were indeed “no”. When I had interviewed for jobs previously,
    <i>PHPCoord</i> was not uncommonly a subject of discussion with my interviewers. Once, one of them revealed during discussion
    that they'd even previously used it! So with a constant 200+ downloads per day, and an eye on my future career
    prospects I was inclined to keep it going.
</p>

<p>
    Secondly, when I searched on <i>Packagist</i> to see what else was out there, there was almost nothing. There were lots
    of geocoding libraries, several geometry libraries and quite a few libraries that did distance calculations (some well,
    some badly). However, for conversions between coordinate systems there was almost nothing. A couple of other projects
    did just British conversions (apparently a popular need!), there was one project that did only Swiss conversions...and there was
    <i>Proj4php</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Proj4php</i> on the surface seemed like an ideal candidate to point people at as a replacement library. The
    <i>Proj</i> C++ library is well-regarded as a backbone of many GIS applications. However, the more I looked into
    <i>Proj4php</i>, the more I despaired. Firstly, it's not maintained by the same people who maintain actual <i>Proj</i>.
    That's a bad sign, because it means that the maintainers are mostly just transliterating someone else's code,
    rather than actually understanding what's going on. Concepts and code structures that make sense for C++, a low level
    language are probably not the same as idiomatic PHP. Secondly, it turns out that it's not a port of <i>Proj</i> the C++ library.
    It's a port of <i>Proj4JS</i>, which is the one that claims to be a port of the original. Being twice-removed from the
    source and its design decisions is even worse than being once-removed
</p>

<p>
    Thirdly, it clearly isn't even trying to keep up with the core project with the commit history positively
    anaemic. <i>Proj4php</i> receives releases approximately once a year, with the changelog for each one typically having
    about 6 entries. Whilst my own project <i>PHPCoord</i> wasn't doing any better, if I was going to point people using it at
    something that claimed to <strong>be</strong> <i>Proj</i> instead, I would have wanted it to at least be attempting to maintain parity
    with the parent project. Some quick research shows that <i>Proj4JS</i> is actually a fork of <i>Proj</i> v4 from the time that Proj
    itself had been having a fairly extensive duration "minimum maintenance" period as a mature project. Modern <i>Proj</i>, that powers
    geospatial engines all over the place actually started to have a fundamental rewrite with
    <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/master/docs/source/news.rst#proj-500"><i>Proj</i> v5</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/master/docs/source/news.rst#600-release-notes"><i>Proj</i> v6</a>. <i>Proj4php</i>
    does not have any of these changes, its fundamental architecture is based on designs that the parent project has
    thrown away as not fit for purpose.
</p>

<p>
    Fourthly, a quick scan through the release history and the outstanding issues, revealed that the conversion from
    <i>Proj4JS</i> has been so badly done, that many of the issues being fixed in each release were not things like confusing the
    return values of e.g. array methods between the two languages, but were fixes to put the missing <code>$</code> in
    front of variable names. Even a basic lint check would have picked up those up (or, um, testing the code),
    but issue, after issue, after issue for years have simply been fixing fatal syntax errors. The whole project to me,
    although obviously well-meaning seems to me to be a complete horrowshow, and I sincerely hope that everyone involved
    are just hobbyists rather than people employed for money as software-writing professionals.

    </a>
</div>

<h2 class="section-heading" id="therewrite">The rewrite</h2>
<p>
    With all that in mind, in August 2020 after <a href="/php-code-coverage">my PHP code coverage work</a> was released
    I decided that I would invest back into <i>PHPCoord</i> to make it something I was proud of. And more than that, that I
    would make an <strong>actual</strong> <i>Proj</i> equivalent for PHP because I'm stubborn like that. Not a port, or
    any kind of copy, but a PHP-native reimagining of that particular problem space. “🎵Everything <i>Proj</i> can do,
    I can do better” would be the new mantra.
</p>

<p>
    I began doing research, discovering in the process just how large a job I had gotten myself into. In late
    August<sup><a href="#fn8" id="f8">8</a></sup>, I made my first commit of the “new” <i>PHPCoord</i> deciding for a
    couple of reasons to utilise a brand new, empty branch for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
    Firstly, I didn't want to be mentally attached to/constrained by the existing code and its structure.
    I wanted to come at things completely afresh (plus, seeing how similar/different the result would be to the current code
    would be intellectually interesting). Secondly <code>v3.0</code>, although now bearing little resemblance to the
    original <i>PHPcoord</i> that I'd forked, was still legally (and morally!) derived from the work of Jonathan Stott and
    thus by necessity was published under the same GPL software license that he had used. Personally I dislike the GPL
    finding it to be very preachy and akin to getting a sermon. If (and only if) I started from scratch and therefore
    avoided all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus</a> type issues, would I be
    safely able to release under a different license, like the MIT.
</p>

<p>
    I released <code>v4.0</code> in March 2021, after releasing a beta in January. It definitely took a <em>lot</em>
    longer than I'd originally anticipated having started way back in August, but the results were definitely worth it!

<p>
    April saw the addition of another major feature, that of the concept that where a coordinate system spans a wide
    area, there are often multiple conversions to/from it that pertain to <em>part</em> of it only. <code>v4.2</code>
    added the necessary polygon awareness to the codebase, with <code>v4.3</code> introducing the concept of “datapacks”,
    8 optional/supplementary <i>Composer</i> packages that increased the accuracy of conversions by supplying the
    necessary high-quality polygons.
</p>

<p>
    <code>v4.4</code> in June went one step further and added the first support for gridfiles, enabling the absolute
    highest accuracy conversions possible, commensurate with output of government tooling like <i>NCAT</i>, <i>GDAy</i>,
    or <i>Circe</i>. The large size of the grid files means that they sadly cannot be distributed with the base package, but are only
    available to datapack users.
</p>

<p>
    <code>v4.5</code> and <code>v4.6</code> from September and October were mainly focused on optimisations.
</p>

<p>
    Annoyingly, rather than have <code>v4.7</code> as the subsequent release, I was forced into releasing it as <code>v5.0</code>
    due to a PHP8.1 deprecation that required changing constructor signature to address. I'd previously had no plans to
    bump the major version again anytime soon, having done it less than a year earlier as it's obviously annoying for
    consuming applications.
</p>

<p>
    Obviously, the research needed to accurate determine the details of over 6000 coordinate systems and how to convert
    between them is a mammoth undertaking, especially compared to the mere 10 that <i>PHPCoord</i> had previously
    supported. Thankfully, I didn't have to do most of this research thanks to <a href="https://epsg.org/">EPSG</a>
    whose work I very gratefully acknowledge. The EPSG dataset includes the definitions, the formulas, the parameters
    and also in many cases worked examples that I was able to use to test the code with. The presence of this valuable
    data inside modern versions of <i>PHPCoord</i> is why the license is the slightly clunky<sup><a href="#fn10" id="f10">10</a></sup>
    <code>(MIT and proprietary)</code> since although the EPSG data is freely redistributable, it has its own license
    rather than anything in the OSI list.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What's next</h2>
<p>
    I'll certainly be doing regular minor releases to pick up new/improved coordinate system data from EPSG. Other than
    that, I have plans to add import/export functionality for commonly used interchange formats like GeoJSON and WKT,
    and some vague ideas about adding to/exposing the internal polygon functionality so that operations other than
    conversions and distance calculations can be done. Maybe I'll write another blog post at the 15 year mark to see how
    those predictions hold up 😁

    The Vincenty formula is more accurate but is slower and over the relatively small distances involved here
    that difference was considered to be negligible. Especially since any formula used would be only be calculating
    straight-line distance rather than actual road distance.

    MySQL at the time did not have built-in support for spatial calculations, so I had to do the calculations the hard way.

    The SQL I constructed first culled the points of interest by evaluating a simple bounding box of roughly a few miles

    remaining points by haversine distance.

    Approximately 15 months later I would have a shower thought and realise that I could just do distance calculations on
    eastings and northings directly using simple Pythagoras rather than the complex trigonometry involved with
    latitudes, longitudes and the haversine formula. Oops<sup><a href="#fn5" id="f5">5</a></sup>.

    By this point though the search tool also had browser geolocation functionality which only returns the user location
    in terms of latitude and longitude. This meant that I did still have a need for coordinate conversions, although now
    it was in the opposite direction! If I'd realised about the Pythagoras trick at the same time I originally started
    using <i>Code-Point Open</i>, I'm not sure that I would have ever sourced conversion routines just for geolocation purposes...
